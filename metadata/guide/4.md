Title: Theme design tips

##Theme design tips

If you are designing your own custom theme we recommend adding the `<koken:discussion>` ([link](http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/articles/828690-lens-tags#kokendiscussion)) tag to any template you'd like to enable discussions with. This tag is used by the Disqus plugin to generate the comment area, and could be used in the future to support competing commenting services as well.

Additionally, if you'd like to display a comment count on a separate page (e.g., Essays) you can do that by adding the `<koken:discussion_count>` tag ([link](http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/articles/828690-lens-tags#kokendiscussion_count)).
