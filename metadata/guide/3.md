By default, Disqus pushes additional "Discovery" content below comments. This content includes links to other pages within your site and links to outside sites as well. If you'd rather not display Discovery content, follow these steps.

1. Sign-in to the Disqus account you created earlier.
2. Click on your site link under the "Your Sites" header in the left column.
3. Click on the "Settings" tab at the far right of the following page.
4. In the initial "General" tab, uncheck "Show links to discussions..." (see figure below).
5. Scroll to the bottom and click "Save Changes".
