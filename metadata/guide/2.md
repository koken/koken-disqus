Title: Color and style

##Discussion color and style

Disqus reads the styles in a comment form's parent HTML page to determine whether it uses a light or dark color scheme. You can read more about that process [in their documentation](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/545277-disqus-appearance-tweaks). If the color scheme Disqus chooses for you doesn't look right, you may override this through your Disqus account. Here's how.

1. Sign-in to the Disqus account you created earlier.
2. Click on your site link under the "Your Sites" header in the left column.
3. Click on the "Settings" tab at the far right of the following page.
4. In the "General" tab will be a "Color scheme" drop-down (see screenshot below). Edit this accordingly.
5. Scroll to the bottom and click "Save Changes".
